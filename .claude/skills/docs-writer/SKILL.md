# Docs Writer

This skill enables the creation and maintenance of high-quality, professional documentation. It emphasizes a "less is more" approach—favoring clarity and brevity over wordy explanations.

## Workflow: Creating/Updating Docs

1.  **Identify Document Type**: Refer to [Doc Types](references/doc-types.md) for the appropriate structure (README, ADR, PRD, etc.).
2.  **Select Template**: Use the templates in `assets/` as a starting point.
3.  **Apply Style Guidelines**: Follow the [Style Guide](references/style-guide.md) to ensure the writing is concise, direct, and active.
4.  **Structure and Format**: Use standard Markdown hierarchies and clear sectioning.
5.  **Review and Refactor**: Prune needless words and ensure information is discoverable.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Document Refactoring

Transform bloated, confusing documentation into clear, structured Markdown. This includes:

- Consolidating redundant sections.
- Flattening deep hierarchies.
- Rewriting passive voice into active, imperative instructions.

### 2. Standardization

Ensure consistency across the entire documentation suite:

- Unified naming conventions.
- Consistent formatting for code blocks and links.
- Standardized templates for ADRs and PRDs.

### 3. "Docs-as-Code" Best Practices

- Semantic Markdown usage.
- TOC generation for long-form content.
- Clean separation between user guides and technical specs.
