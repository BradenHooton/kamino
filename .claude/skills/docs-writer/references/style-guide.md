# Documentation Writing style Guide

Follow these principles to ensure documentation is effective, readable, and maintainable.

## 1. Core Principles

### Be Concise

- Omit needless words.
- Use short sentences and simple words.
- If it's possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
- Avoid flowery prose or "marketing speak."

### Be Direct

- Use the active voice. (e.g., "Install the dependency" instead of "The dependency should be installed").
- Lead with the most important information.
- Use imperative verbs for instructions (e.g., "Run," "Configure," "Update").

### Be Clear

- Avoid jargon unless it's standard in the domain.
- Define acronyms on first use.
- Use explicit references instead of pronouns ("Click the Submit button" vs "Click it").

## 2. Formatting Standards

### Markdown Best Practices

- **Headers**: Use a single `# H1` per document. Follow a logical hierarchy (`##`, `###`).
- **Lists**: Use bullet points for items and numbered lists for sequential steps.
- **Code**: Always use fenced code blocks with the correct language identifier.
- **Bold/Italic**: Use bold for UI elements or critical terms. Use italics sparingly for emphasis.

### Organization

- Use a Table of Contents for long documents.
- Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences max).
- Use horizontal rules (`---`) to separate major conceptual sections.

## 3. Review Checklist

- [ ] Is the purpose of this document clear within the first 2 sentences?
- [ ] Are all instructions tested and accurate?
- [ ] Is the hierarchy of information logical?
- [ ] Have all "filler" words been removed?
- [ ] Is the formatting consistent throughout?
